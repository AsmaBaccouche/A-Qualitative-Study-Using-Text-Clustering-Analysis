# A Qualitative Study using Text Clustering Analysis

Text clustering is an important task for effectively organizing, summarizing and qualifying text
information. Due to the sparseness of the traditional text representation, short text clustering has
become a challenging problem, but many effective text-learning methods have been proposed to
represent the text data set, like statistics-based methods, semantic similarity methods, deep learning
methods, and latent topic modeling. In this work, we present an improved implementation of some
text clustering and categorization algorithms, of academic publications’ titles across the
domains/departments, in order to emphasize the interaction between the different fields of research in
of Speed School of Engineering (UofL) departments.
Our framework provides a comparative analysis of the methods and an evaluation of the experimental results.

In this project, we implemented an improved clustering analysis algorithms for text
categorization, using an efficient text representation. The methods included a comparison of the k-means
algorithm with the GMM text representation and the interpretation of the topic modeling results after
demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. The framework includes also a weighted kmeans
algorithm that outperformed the tradition k-means algorithm, where we obtained better
clustering results and more reasonable topic trends. We also introduced a topic-modeling algorithm
using the Online LDA (OLDA) in order to generate an efficient text representation, and we compared
the results of the k-means with word2vec embedding model.
