# A-Qualitative-Study-of-Speed-School-of-Engineering-Publications-Using-Text-Clustering-Analysis

Text clustering is an important task for effectively organizing, summarizing and qualifying text
information. Due to the sparseness of the traditional text representation, short text clustering has
become a challenging problem, but many effective text-learning methods have been proposed to
represent the text data set, like statistics-based methods, semantic similarity methods, deep learning
methods, and latent topic modeling. In this work, we present an improved implementation of some
text clustering and categorization algorithms, of academic publicationsâ€™ titles across the
domains/departments, in order to emphasize the interaction between the different fields of research in
of Speed School of Engineering (UofL) departments.
Our framework provides a comparative analysis of the methods and an evaluation of the experimental results.
